# Step 0: Setup Github and video saving methods and see if you like Machine Learning with EdgeImpulse. (Materials Cost: $0 assuming you have an internet capable computer and a cell phone)

# Step 1: Arduino Portenta with LoRa Vision Shield. Lets do some TinyML Machine Learning with Edge Impulse  (Materials Cost: ~ $300 USD).

# Step 2: Generic Arduino and soldering. World famous Arduino simplification.  (Material Cost: ~ $150 USD ).

# Step 3: Arduino Portenta with Sensors (2 wire, SPI, I2C, UArt), Actuators (motors, LED's) and Communication (Wifi, Ethernet, BLE, LoRa, LoRaWan) (Material Cost: ~ $500 USD ).

# Step 4: Specializations any of: 3D printing, or micro-soldering, or electronic testing, or RC toy car (Material Cost: ~ $700 USD each ).

# Step 5: Planning your final project (Material Cost: ~ $200 USD --> ? ).

# Step 6: Final Project Completion / Presentation /Startup (Material Cost: $0 ).
