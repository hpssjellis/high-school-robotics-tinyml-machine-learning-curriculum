# Robotics and Machine Learning for the Technologically Tenacious!

# Maker100 Online without in-person support, a potentially faster or at your own pace approach to the in-classroom [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) course. 

The [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) course is for in-person instruction in a Robotics / computer lab with a knowledgeable teacher.

This page is for anyone wishing to do the course from home. It is closely linked to the price list so you can have minimal costs while testing if this method is  orrect for you.

### Step 0: Setup Github and video saving methods and see if you like Machine Learning with EdgeImpulse. (Materials Cost: $0 assuming you have an internet capable computer also preferably a cell phone)

####  Step 1: Arduino Portenta with LoRa Vision Shield. Lets do some TinyML Machine Learning with Edge Impulse  ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-1-machine-learning-with-the-portentah7-and-lora-vision-shield-on-edgeimpulsecom) Cost: ~ $300 USD).

####  Step 2: Generic Arduino abilities, sensors and soldering. World famous Arduino simplification.  ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-2-generic-sensor-and-arduino-equipment) Cost: ~ $150 USD ).

####  Step 3: Arduino Portenta with Sensors (2 wire, SPI, I2C, UArt), Actuators (motors, LED's) and Communication (Wifi, Ethernet, BLE, LoRa, LoRaWan) ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-3-maker100-sensors-and-motors-actuators) Cost: ~ $500 USD ).

####  Step 4: Specializations any of: 3D printing, or micro-soldering, or electronic testing, or RC toy car ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-4-technology-equipment-based-on-interests) Cost: <= ~$700 USD   ).

####  Step 5: Planning your final project ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-1-machine-learning-with-the-portentah7-and-lora-vision-shield-on-edgeimpulsecom-) Cost: >= $100 USD  ).

####  Step 6: Final Project Completion / Presentation /Startup (Materials Cost: $0 ).

#### Total cost about $1750 USD, Duration to complete, from about 2 weeks to 3 years.

## Note: No fees, but also no support for using this Online-Maker100 program
