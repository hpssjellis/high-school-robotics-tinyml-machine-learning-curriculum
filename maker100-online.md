# Robotics and Machine Learning for the Technologically Tenacious!

# Maker100 Online without in-person support,   
Potentially faster or at your own pace approach to the in-classroom [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) course. 


This page is for anyone wishing to do the course from home. It is closely linked to the [materials price list](price-list-individuals.md) so you can have minimal costs while testing if this method is correct for you.

# Quick Overview

#### [Step 0:](#step-0-setup) Setup Github and video saving methods and see if you like Machine Learning with EdgeImpulse. (Materials Cost: $0 assuming you have an internet capable computer also preferably a cell phone)

####  [Step 1:]() Arduino Portenta with LoRa Vision Shield. Lets do some TinyML Machine Learning with Edge Impulse  ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-1-machine-learning-with-the-portentah7-and-lora-vision-shield-on-edgeimpulsecom) Cost: ~ $300 USD).

####  [Step 2:]() Generic Arduino abilities, sensors and soldering. World famous Arduino simplification.  ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-2-generic-sensor-and-arduino-equipment) Cost: ~ $150 USD ).

####  [Step 3:]() Arduino Portenta with Sensors (2 wire, SPI, I2C, UArt), Actuators (motors, LED's) and Communication (Wifi, Ethernet, BLE, LoRa, LoRaWan) ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-3-maker100-sensors-and-motors-actuators) Cost: ~ $500 USD ).

####  [Step 4:]() Specializations any of: 3D printing, or micro-soldering, or electronic testing, or RC toy car ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-4-technology-equipment-based-on-interests) Cost: <= ~$700 USD   ).

####  [Step 5:]() Planning your final project ([Materials](price-list-individuals.md#step-1-machine-learning-with-the-portentah7-and-lora-vision-shield-on-edgeimpulsecom-) Cost: >= $100 USD  ).

####  [Step 6:]() Final Project Completion / Presentation /Startup (Materials Cost: $0 ).

#### Total cost about $1750 USD, Duration to complete, from about 2 weeks to 3 years.

## Note: No fees, but also no support for using this Online-Maker100 program



#Let's get started!

# Step 0: Setup.

1. A place to save short videos of everything you have done. Suggestions https://www.office.com/  https://www.youtube.com/  https://one.google.com/  https://www.dropbox.com/  (If you are at a school check what they use, best to share a folder that has all your videos saved in the order you have made them)


1. Find something (favorite toy, special pen, sheet of paper with your name on it) to show in the background of every video to prove it is you. Many schools prefer students to not show their face so a symbol is the best alternative


1. Make short videos after you have done the next steps.


1. https://github.com/ login (Sensible login name as this public Github is part of your adult resume) Then make a repository with a README.md file saying your first name only and in a public folder an index.html file saying your first name and something about Robotics and Machine Learning. See [Github Setup Video here]() (not yet ready)


1. https://edgeimpulse.com/ login, Start making your first Machine Learning model, using your computer webcam or (easier using a cell phone) See [edgeImpulse First Model Video Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbX_-No8kIw&list=PL57Dnr1H_egsQPnEObWHPhK1Q4g_IDWcR&index=8). Set the speed slower if your don't like the Chipmunk voice. See other videos in the playlist if you need more help.


1. Tell whoever is getting your equipment that you have finished step 0, and need your Step 1 equipment purchased. (If they have access to your video folder they can see your short proof videos)
