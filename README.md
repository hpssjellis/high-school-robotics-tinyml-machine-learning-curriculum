## Course:

|Topic| Arduino 1.8? IDE| Arduino 2.? IDE| Arduino Cloud| Platform.IO |Gitpod|
|-------------------|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1. Auto Blink and Serial print  |    |    |    |     |    |
| 2. Button cause blink   |    |    |    |     |    |

## Pre-Understanding:
1. Circuits as multiple serial and parallel loops
2. Microcontroller Max current, Max voltage
3. Ohms Law V=IxR and Power equations
4. Electrical Safety
5. Non-microncontroller electric circuits: switch on a motor etc. I use [Snapcircuits 750](https://www.robotshop.com/en/elenco-snap-circuits-educational-series-training-program-sc-750r.html) I uuse the old version that comes in a box, this case version would be good, but any circuit play would be fine including online circuit visualizers.
6. 6 Circuit components: Resistor, Diode, Transistor, Coil, Capacitor, Chip



## Platforms:   
[Arduino Regualar IDE  Version 1.8.??  Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Decade long tested, works great

[Arduino New IDE Version 2.?.?  Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Has some advantages, but still farily Beta

[Arduinio Cloud](https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/iot-cloud/tutorials/iot-cloud-getting-started) Has online advatages, verey powerful with Paid version but also has issues

[Platformio](https://platformio.org/)  Easy install of Visual Studio Code has lots of advantages, bit of a learning curve

[Draft My Gitpod of Edge impulsee](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-of-edge-impulse) Huge learning curve, but has the benefit of complete control of cloud setup for students, loads [here](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-of-edge-impulse)


## Post Understanding Activites:

1.  Individual Final Project with at least one sensor and one actuator
    1. Proof of Concept (POC) Sensor Actuator working
    2. Useful and/or fun
    3. Structure designed (3d Printed if needed)
    4. Final Project Prototype ready
2. If time final project with more sensors and actuators
3. If time Group Project



## Course Notes:

1. Made for Makers not for future [Mechatronic Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics): Why? This course is to inspire Makers and future engineers, but to simplify the teaching I teach some things different than an Engineer would prefer. The positive is that the few students I see who have the: Drive, Ability and Finanaces to become Engineers typically ignore me and get the assignments done really fast. Example: I code Javascript using Notepad.exe on windows, I don't even use Notepad++ a soon to be engineer might load a different editor like "[Atom](https://atom.io/)" and I am fine with that, I just don't want to wasste my teaching time getting editors installed on school and student home computers.
